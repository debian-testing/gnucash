Notes for this directory
------------------------

The subdirectory glossary/ contains a glossary of the financial terms
used inside GnuCash. To achieve a decent consistency in terminology
within GnuCash, it is recommended to translate it before your "real" po file
and to use it during the translation process. There is one po files per
translation of the glossary.
The english definitions are in the file gnc-glossary.txt
which is a tab-delimited ASCII table with each table cell enclosed in
double quotation marks ("). If the file gnc-glossary.txt was updated,
you can build a new glossary.pot file by using the shell script
txt-to-pot.sh so that you can update the po file.
